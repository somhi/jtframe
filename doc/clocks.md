# Game clocks

Games are expected to operate on a 48MHz clock using clock enable signals. There is an optional 6MHz that can be enabled with the macro **JTFRAME_CLK6**. This clock goes in the game module through a _clk6_ port which is only connected to when that macro is defined. _jtbtiger_ is an example of game using this feature.

 clock input | Macro Needed
-------------|--------------
clk          | 48MHz unless JTFRAME_SDRAM96 is defined, then 96MHz
clk96        | JTFRAME_CLK96
clk48        | JTFRAME_CLK48
clk24        | JTFRAME_CLK24
clk6         | JTFRAME_CLK6

Note that although clk6 and clk24 are obtained without affecting the main clock input, if **JTFRAME_SDRAM96** is defined, the main clock input moves up from 48MHz to 96MHz. The 48MHz clock can the be obtained from clk48 if **JTFRAME_CLK48** is defined too. This implies that the SDRAM will be clocked at 96MHz instead of 48MHz. The constraints in the SDC files have to match this clock variation.

If STA was to be run on these pins, the SDRAM clock would have to be assigned the correct PLL output in the SDC file but this is hard to do because the TCL language subset used by Quartus seems to lack control flow statements. So we are required to do another text edit hack on the fly, which is not nice. Apart from changing the PLL output, when using 96MHz clock the input data should have a multicycle path constraint as it takes an extra clock cycle for the data to be ready. If you just change the PLL clock then you'll find plenty of timing problems unless you define the multicycle path constraint.

This is the code needed:

```
create_generated_clock -name SDRAM_CLK -source \
    [get_pins {emu|pll|pll_inst|altera_pll_i|general[5].gpll~PLL_OUTPUT_COUNTER|divclk}] \
    -divide_by 1 \
    [get_ports SDRAM_CLK]

set_multicycle_path -from [get_ports {SDRAM_DQ[*]}] -to [get_clocks {emu|pll|pll_inst|altera_pll_i|general[4].gpll~PLL_OUTPUT_COUNTER|divclk}] -setup -end 2

set_multicycle_path -from [get_ports {SDRAM_DQ[*]}] -to [get_clocks {emu|pll|pll_inst|altera_pll_i|general[4].gpll~PLL_OUTPUT_COUNTER|divclk}] -hold -end 2
```

This only applies to MiSTer. For MiST the approach is different and there are two different PLL modules which produce the SDRAM clock at the same pin. So a single `create_generated_clock` applies to both. Due to different SDRAM shifts used, the multicycle path constraint does not seem needed in MiST.

The script **jtcore** handles this process transparently.

By default unless **JTFRAME_MR_FASTIO** is already defined, **JTFRAME_CLK96** will define it to 1. This enables fast ROM download in MiSTer using 16-bit mode in _hps_io_.

## Clock Enable Signals

Most core modules will need to operate at a frequency different from the master clock, **clk**. This is achieved by using clock enable signals (*cen*), which are high exactly for one pulse cycle. There are several modules in [hdl/clocking](../hdl/clocking) that help creating these *cen* signals but the preferred method is to define them in the cfg/mem.yaml file.

*cen* signals can be defined in terms of a multiplier and a divider, which is handy when the original system follows that method, or with an absolute frequency in hertz. Each definition is tied to a specific JTFRAME clock (clk6, clk24, clk48 or clk96) and for absolute value calculations, the **JTFRAME_PLL** macro is taken into account. Thus the desired frequency will be obtained regardless of which clock and which PLL you choose for the design.

Example from **jtroadf** core:

```
clocks:
  clk24:
    - mul: 1
      div: 4
      outputs:
        - cpu4
        - ti1
        - ti2
    - freq: 3579545
      outputs:
        - snd
        - psg
```

For each output listed, the result frequency is divided by 2. Thus cpu4_cen will operate at clk24/4, ti1_cen will be clk24/8 and ti2_cen clk24/16. Similarly, psg_cen will be half the frequency of snd_cen. All signals listed in _outputs_ will have the suffix *_cen* added and they will become input ports to the _game_ module.

You can specify several clock domains, clk24, clk48, etc. If you move _cen_ signals from one domain to another, make sure the right clock is used in the _game_ module too for each respective _cen_.

# Internal JTFRAME clocks

The clocks passed to the target subsystem (jtframe_mist, jtframe_mister or jtframe_neptuno) are three:

clock     |  Use                    | Frequency
----------|-------------------------|--------------------
clk_sys   | Video & general purpose | same as game clock **clk**
clk_rom   | SDRAM access            | same as clk_sys or higher
clk_pico  | picoBlaze clock         | 48MHz

clk_rom is controlled by the macros **JTFRAME_SDRAM96**
clk_sys is normally 48MHz, even if clk_rom is 96MHz. It can be set to 96MHz with **JTFRAME_CLK96**.

Games can move these frequencies by replacing the PLL (using the **JTFRAME_PLL** macro) but the changes should be within Â±10% of the expected values.

JTFRAME_PLL     |    Base clock    | Pixel clocks  | Used on
----------------|------------------|---------------|-------------
jtframe_pll6000 |    48/96         | 8 and 6 MHz   | Most JT cores. Used by default
jtframe_pll6144 |    49.152        | 6.144         | JTKICKER, JTTWIN16
jtframe_pll6293 |    50.3496       | 6.2937        | JTS16
jtframe_pll6671 |    53.372        | 6.671         | JTRASTAN

For example, to use a 6.144 MHz pixel clock use `JTFRAME_PLL=jtframe_pll6144` in the .def file.

The game module input clocks are multiples of the base clock:

 clock input | Default  | jtframe_pll6144
-------------|----------|------------------
clk          |  48      |   49.152
clk96        |  96      |   98.304
clk48        |  48      |   49.152
clk24        |  24      |   24.576
clk6         |   6      |    6.144

# Pixel Clock

All cores must define two clock enable signals based on clk_rom:

- pxl_cen is the pixel clock. A typical value is 6MHz
- pxl2_cen runs at twice the frequency of pxl_cen

As clock enable signals, these should not be high for more than one clock cycle. Some modules may expect an idle cycle after the active one.

Most cores define these two signals as output ports. But it is possible to have them as input ports and leave JTFRAME to handle them by defining **JTFRAME_PXLCLK** to be either 6, 8 or 12. JTFRAME will generate them correctly provided regardless of whether the SDRAM is set to 48 or 96MHz.

**JTFRAME_PXLCLK** will divide clk_rom by 4, 6 or 8 (for a 48MHz reference). If **JTFRAME_PLL** is used, note that those two are the only valid values. Because of the PLL, the actual frequency will be off 6MHz, which is the intention of using **JTFRAME_PLL** in the first place.

JTFRAME_PXLCLK  | pxl2_cen  | pxl_cen
----------------|-----------|---------
     12         |   24      |   12
      8         |   16      |    8
      6         |   12      |    6
